# Hey there! I'm Davide ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer from Italy now living in Berlin, Germany. I've been engineering software professionally for
**11+ years**â€”but truth is, I've been at this for over 20. Started young and never really stopped.

## What I do

I specialize in **backend development** with **PHP and Symfony** ([community member since
2009](https://connect.symfony.com/profile/dbellettini)), and I'm comfortable jumping into **frontend work** when
needed. I regularly write production code in **Scala**, and I've always had a soft spot for **JVM languages**.
I also enjoy working with **Node.js and TypeScript**.

For data persistence, I favor **PostgreSQL** for relational databases and appreciate **MongoDB** for its operational
simplicity and high availability features. I'm also experienced with **MySQL**.

I also love contributing to **infrastructure** and have a deep appreciation for **Terraform** and **OpenTofu** for
infrastructure as code. **Docker** is part of everything I do, both at work and in side projects.

I do my best work in environments where people care about thoughtful engineering, clean architecture, and continuous
learning. I'm passionate about **Domain-Driven Design** and **Test-Driven Development**, applying these principles to
create well-structured, maintainable software. As a **curious and relentless learner**, I'm always seeking new knowledge
and pushing for **continuous improvement** in everything I build.

I leverage **Large Language Models** extensively in both development workflows and product integration, but I believe
that "LLMs won't stop you from going full speed in the wrong direction." Technology is a toolâ€”the real skill lies in
asking the right questions, understanding complex domain problems, and applying solid engineering principles to build
solutions that truly serve users.

## A bit about me

When I'm not coding, I'm behind a drum kit or playing bass guitar. My first lines of code were on a
**Commodore 64**â€”those were the days. I love collaborating with teams that value quality over quick fixes.
