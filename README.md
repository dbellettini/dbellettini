# Hi, I'm Davide
I'm a passionate Software Engineer with a lifelong love for computer science, which began at the age of 6 with a Commodore 64. I'm a curious problem-solver who enjoys learning and growing through new experiences. Based in Berlin since 2021, I thrive on exploring innovative projects and contributing to impactful solutions.
